# AuditTrace WebUI — minimalist OIDC + chat probe + memory backoffice

A single-page browser harness that exercises the full
**OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE** flow against the `audittrace-webui`
Keycloak client, then uses the resulting JWT to:

1. Hit `/v1/chat/completions` (the **Chat** tab — original purpose).
2. Administer the three non-conversational memory layers via the
   v1.0.3 CRUD endpoints (the **Memory** tab — added v1.0.5).

This is a **harness**, not a product. It exists to:

1. Provide a real browser-side flow (rather than a CLI helper) for
   live-evidence screenshots that demonstrate ADR-042 (BFF-first OIDC)
   and ADR-044 (External IdP federation via Keycloak brokering).
2. Give a concrete example of the protocol any future first-party UI
   (LibreChat, audit dashboards) can lift verbatim. Vanilla JS, no
   build step.
3. Let an operator validate that the realm wiring is correct without
   spinning up LibreChat.
4. Let an operator administer ADRs / SKILLs / semantic docs from a
   browser instead of `kubectl exec`-ing a pod and running
   `seed-memory.py`. Per-layer write scopes gate every action and
   buttons gray out when the JWT is missing the right scope.

The full first-party UI work lives separately under M3 (LibreChat
Day-1, see `project_m3_librechat_split` memory). This webui is
deliberately *minimal* — it is not LibreChat in disguise.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Make sure k3s is up and Keycloak's `audittrace-webui` client exists
#    (see Phase 1 of the M2 runbook).

# 2. Serve the webui at http://localhost:8765/
./webui/serve.py
#    or, equivalently:  python3 -m http.server -d webui --bind 127.0.0.1 8765

# 3. Open http://localhost:8765/ in a browser.
# 4. Click "Sign in" → Keycloak → (optional) federated IdP → JWT.
# 5. Click "Send /v1/chat/completions".
```

## What the page does

- **PKCE generation** in `crypto.subtle` — random verifier, SHA-256
  challenge, stored in `localStorage` across the redirect.
- **Authorization Code flow** with optional `kc_idp_hint` parameter
  to pre-select a brokered IdP (e.g. `google-test`).
- **Token exchange** against `/realms/audittrace/protocol/openid-connect/token`.
- **JWT decoding** — header.payload split + base64url decode of the
  payload, displayed inline.
- **Chat probe** (Chat tab) — `POST /v1/chat/completions` with the
  JWT as bearer; response shown inline.
- **Memory backoffice** (Memory tab) — full CRUD on episodic /
  procedural / semantic layers via the v1.0.3 endpoints. Per-layer
  layer-pill switcher; manifest table with key, title,
  `modified_at_ms` (rendered UTC), `modified_by_user_id`, soft-delete
  state; New / Edit / Delete (soft) actions on each row. Buttons
  disable when the JWT lacks `memory:<layer>:write` so the operator
  sees the scope gate before clicking.

## Trust model + scope

- **Localhost-only.** `serve.py` binds 127.0.0.1, never `0.0.0.0`.
  The page is for the operator running the live-evidence test, not
  for LAN users.
- **No service worker. No persistence beyond sessionStorage.** Closing
  the tab clears the token.
- **No build step. No external CDN.** Everything inline. Audit-friendly.
- **Default `state` + PKCE.** The page rejects code returns whose
  `state` doesn't match what was put in `sessionStorage`.

The redirect URI `http://localhost:8765/*` MUST be registered on the
`audittrace-webui` client. The Keycloak realm JSON
(`keycloak/realm-audittrace.json`) ships with this URI in the client's
`redirectUris` list.

## Configuration

All four fields are editable in the page itself (top panel) so you can
re-point the harness at a different realm or memory-server without
editing code:

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Issuer | `https://audittrace.local:30952/realms/audittrace` | Keycloak realm base URL |
| Client ID | `audittrace-webui` | Public PKCE client |
| Redirect URI | `http://localhost:8765/` | Must match a registered `redirectUris` entry |
| Scopes | `openid audittrace:query audittrace:audit memory:*` | Drives `defaultClientScopes` exposure |
| IdP hint | `google-test` (M2) | `kc_idp_hint` query param — leave blank to show the chooser |
| API base | `https://audittrace.local:30952` | `POST {API}/v1/chat/completions` |

If your hosts file doesn't map `audittrace.local`, edit it to point at
the k3s node, or change the issuer URL to whatever your gateway
exposes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Redirect URI mismatch error from Keycloak | `http://localhost:8765/*` missing from the live `audittrace-webui` client's `redirectUris`. Re-run the kcadm provisioner step from the M2 runbook. |
| `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` on the issuer URL | Browser doesn't trust the local `audittrace.local` cert. Either install the CA (`~/.config/audittrace/ca.crt`) into the browser's trust store, or accept the warning once. |
| `403 Forbidden` from `/v1/chat/completions` | Token missing the `audittrace:query` scope. Check that `defaultClientScopes` on the `audittrace-webui` client includes it (set on first creation; verify via kcadm). |
| `401 Unauthorized — Invalid issuer` | The token's `iss` claim isn't in `AUDITTRACE_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER_EXTRAS`. Double-check the chart's value matches the public Keycloak URL. |
| Chat probe shows CORS error | `webOrigins` on the client doesn't include `http://localhost:8765`. The realm ships with this in webOrigins; if missing, re-apply via kcadm. |

- ADR-044 — External IdP federation via Keycloak brokering (M2)
- `keycloak/realm-audittrace.json` — declares the `audittrace-webui` client
- `scripts/setup-idp-federation.sh` — provisions the brokered IdP
